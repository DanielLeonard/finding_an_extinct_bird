            <h2 id="intro"> Rediscovered by a Persevering Doctor, the Flightless, Colorful Takahe, or 'Wanderer', Struggles to Survive</h2>

            <h3> By R. V. Francis Smith</h3>
</div>


            <p>In New Zealand's rugged Fiordland a bird thought <strong>extinct</strong> for <em>fifty</em> years is struggling for survival. Behind the rare species in its fight for life is all the protective power of the Dominion Government.</p>

            <p>Rediscovery of this flightless bird, the large, brilliant-hued native rail which the <i>Maoris</i> called <em>takahea,</em> meaning "<i>wandering at large</i>," excited almost as much interest in New Zealand as discovery of a living passenger
                pigeon would arouse in America.</p>

            <p>To zoologists and bird lovers throughout the world, reappearance of <i>takahea</i>, now called the <em>takahe</em>, was a notable event. They had a scientific name for the <i>creature–Notornis hochstetteri</i>, the first half of which means
                "<i>bird of the south</i>"–but they knew tantalizingly little about it and had considered it lost in the limbo of vanished species.</p>

            <p> To the rediscoverer, <em>Dr. G. B. Orbell</em>, a physician of Invercargill, New Zealand, the dramatic sight of a takahe alive came as the reward of years of patient and systematic search. Only four of the birds were known to science when
                he made his discovery on the shore of a lake in what is now called <i>Notornis Valley</i>. Since August, <i>1898</i>, there had been no authentic report of one being caught, or even seen. </p>

          </div>


            <p>A primitive type of large moor hen found only in New Zealand, the <i>takahe</i> is unlike any other member of the world-wide rail family to which it belongs. For example, despite its membership in an aquatic family, it avoids swamps and rivers.
                It does, however, share some of the clan 's characteristics, such as a large frontal shield.</p>

            <p>The full-grown <i>takahe</i> stands some <em>twenty inches</em> high and weighs about <em>six pounds</em>. The wings, though incapable of flight, may have a <em>three-foot</em> span.</p>

            <p>The adult bird is vividly colored. Head, neck, breast, and flanks are an iridescent indigo blue, becoming brighter on the shoulders and changing to a malachite green on the mantle. The dark rump and upper tail coverts are olive green, the
                abdomen and thighs purplish black, and the under tail coverts white. The powerful beak is scarlet at the base, fading outwards to a wax pink. Legs and feet are red, eyes reddish brown.</p>

            <p>This brilliant color scheme is seen to full advantage only when the bird is approaching the observer or passing at right angles to him.</p>

            <p>In contrast to its showy parents, the young takahe wears only a uniform, soft black down. The black beak is white-tipped, and the disproportionately large legs are a pale purple.</p>

            <p>In New Zealand's ornithological history, <strong>extinction</strong>, or <strong>near extinction</strong>, has been the lot of many species as a result of <em>settlement</em>.</p>

            <div class="blockquote_holder">

                <blockquote>"It originally occurred throughout forest and grass ecosystems. Today it is restricted to alpine tussock grasslands on the mainland and feeds primarily on juices from the bases of snow tussock and a species of fern rhizome. It eats introduced
                    grasses on the islands. It usually lays <em>two eggs</em> and chicks can begin breeding at the end of <i>first year</i>, but usually start in their <em>second</em>. It is long-lived, probably <em>14-20</em> years."
                </blockquote>

            </div>

            <p>Originally, native birds had <strong>no enemies</strong>, and the vegetation which affords them cover was not subject to browsing by animals. Under these favorable conditions many unusual forms of life, including birds of little or no <em>survive</em>                and <em>thrive</em>.</p>

            </div>

            <p> Before the arrival of <em>Capt. James Cook</em> in, <i>1769</i>, birds were the dominant land vertebrates. The only land mammals were the <i>dog</i>, a <i>Polynesian rat</i>, and two species of <i>bats</i>. The dog and rat had been introduced
                by the <i>Maoris</i> on their second migration, about <i>A. D. 1150</i>. *</p>

            <p>After the <i>Maoris</i> had caused the <strong>extinction</strong> of the <i>huge flightless moa</i>, one species of which was twelve feet high, European settlement brought about more extensive changes. Ferrets, stoats, and weasels were introduced
                to control a plague of rabbits, and these, with cats, dogs, and other predators, virtually sealed the fate of numerous native species, among them the takahe. </p>

            <p> The first living <i>takahe</i> known to Europeans was purposely <strong>killed</strong> and eaten. It was caught by a sealing gang on <i>Resolution Island</i>, near the southwest end of South Island , in <i>1849</i>. <em>Two years</em> later
                a party of <i>Maoris</i> caught a `<em>second</em> bird in <i>Thompson Sound</i>, about <em>forty miles</em> farther north.</p>

            <p>Luckily, the skins of both birds were obtained by <em>Mr. W. D. B. Mantell</em>, who in <i>1847</i> had <b>(duly named Notornis mantelli by Sir Richard Owen, of London)</b>. The skins were sent to the British Museum.</p>

            <p><em>Twenty-eight</em> years passed before another specimen appeared. A <i>rabbiter's</i> dog caught it near the south end of Lake Te Anau. The bird was destined for the cooking pot when it <em>rescued</em> by a farm manager and eventually
                sold to a museum in <i>Dresden, Germany</i>, for <em>£105.</em></p>

            <p>After close examination, <em>Dr. Adolph B. Meyer</em> of the <i>Dresden</i> museum found that this bird was sufficiently different from the North Island semi fossil form found by <i>Mantell</i> to warrant a distinct name. Accordingly, the
                name <em>Notornis hochstetteri</em> was given the present species.</p>

            <p>The <em>fourth</em> specimen was caught by a dog on the shore of <i>Middle Fiord of Lake Te Anau</i> in <i>1898</i>. The bird was bought by the Government for <em>£250</em> to ensure that it remained in New Zealand. Preserved in the <i>Otago Museum at Dunedin</i>,
                it still is the <em>only</em> mounted specimen in the country, for no more <i>takahe</i> were known until Dr. Orbell's discovery.</p>

            <p><i>Notornis Valley</i>, in <i>South Island's Murchison Mountains</i>, lies only <em>six miles</em> from a main road; Dr. G. B. Orbell, an <i>Invercargill physician</i>, reiused to believe the creature lost. After <em>thirty years</em> his
                quest succeeded; Dr. Orbell tracked the <i>takahe</i> to the scene of its wildest parts of the <i>Dominion</i>.</p>

            <p>Dr. Orbell's interest in the creature began more than <i>thirty</i> years ago when, as a boy, he found an old photograph showing the museum bird in a case. His mother told its story and explained that the bird was supposed to be <strong>extinct</strong>.</p>



            <p>That word <em>"supposed"</em> stimulated Dr. Orbell's adventurous spirit, and he learned all he could about the species. From game rangers and from men who had probed the fastnesses of <i>Fiordland</i>, from hearsay and from stories told around
                campfires on numerous hunting trips, Dr. Orbell picked up fragments of information about possible <i>takahe</i> hiding places.</p>

            <p>In <i>1945</i> Dr. Orbell built a summer home at <i>Lake Te Anau</i>, where two of the birds had been caught. The question of the <i>takahe's</i> existence and whereabouts was always with him, but he seldom mentioned the matter except jokingly
                or as a bait to catch information. In this way he learned that a man who knew the country round <em>loaded</em> when in a certain area.</p>

          </div>

            <p>From observations over three nesting seasons, it seems that most, if not ail, of the birds in the main <i>Notornis Valley</i> breed yearly, but very few chicks are hatched and raised. In the <i>1949-50</i> season, <i>40 percent</i> of February,
                <i>1950</i>, only <em>one</em> remained alive. It is now known, however, that several birds besides those under observation were nesting.</p>

            <p>The availability of snow grass and other food during severe winters, when the area is deeply covered with snow, is an important factor in the survival of the species. A dead adult bird, untouched by predators, was found in the main valley
                in the spring of <i>1949</i>. This and other complete skeletons have suggested that starvation is a not uncommon cause of death.</p>

            <p>Every endeavor is being made to preserve these contemporaries of New Zealand's <strong>extinct</strong> <i>giant moa</i>, <i>swan</i>, and <i>eagle</i>, interesting creatures sorely missed. But if measures to combat predators prove ineffective,
                if nesting shelter and food suffer serious depletion, if a severe winter strikes, or if infertility increases-if anyone or a combination of these mishaps overtakes back-to-the-wall notornis -then the species must inevitably join the <i>heath hen</i>,
                <i>the dodo</i>, <i>the great auk</i>, and others that are <strong>lost</strong> to the world forever.</p>

            <p>New Zealand is a fertile and mountainous group of islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. "It is a land uplifted high," wrote <strong>Abel Tasman</strong>, a Dutch navigator who was the first European to sight New Zealand, in <i>1642</i>.
                Snowy peaks, fjord-scarred shores, and pastures dotted with sheep define this country.</p>

            <p>New Zealand, a parliamentary democracy modeled on that of the United Kingdom, has been a self-governing British dominion since <i>1907</i>. It became a founding member of the British Commonwealth in <i>1926</i>.</p>

            <p><em>One in three</em> citizens—Kiwis—lives in or around the city of <i>Auckland</i>. Rugby clubs with names such as <i>Canterbury</i> and <i>Wellington</i> reveal a nation peopled mostly by descendants of British settlers. The indigenous <i>Maori</i>                constitute about <em>15 percent</em> of New Zealanders; recent immigrants—primarily from <i>Samoa</i> and <i>Fiji</i>—make Auckland one of the world's largest Polynesian cities.</p>

            <p>The export-driven country, whose chief trading partner used to be the <i>United Kingdom</i>, faltered in <i>1973</i> when Britain joined the European Union. The loss of preferential treatment prompted a search for new markets. Japan, <em>half of all</em>                exports, which include wool, mutton, lamb, beef, cheese, fish, and chemicals.</p>

            <p>New Zealand plays an active role in helping democratic nations and emerging Pacific island economies. It sent troops to East Timor when violence broke out in <i>1999</i>, and it provided <em>millions</em> of dollars to the South Pacific island
                of Niue after it was devastated by a tropical <em>cyclone</em> in <i>2004</i>. <i>Niue</i> and the <i>Cook Islands</i> enjoy a status of self-government in free association with New Zealand.</p>
